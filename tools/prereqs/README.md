# Bedrock and SPK Prerequisites

Working with Spk and Bedrock in general requires a set up prerequisites to be installed.  Those prerequisites are as follows:

- Azure CLI
- Kubectl
- Helm
- Fabrikate
- Terraform

In order to facilitate the ease of installing these requirements, a set of scripts has been created that will install each prereq individually.  Some of these scripts assume you are running upon an Ubuntu Linux system and they use `apt` to install the components.

The scripts can be found [here](./).
